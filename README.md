# odin-landing-page
Landing page project in odin web development course focusing on the use of flexbox to replicate "desired-outcome.png" with css and html. This is my second project using html now adding my newly gained knowledge of css and flexbox. I hope to gain further confidence in using these tools and a better understanding of the most efficient way they can be used in order to produce my desired outcome.
